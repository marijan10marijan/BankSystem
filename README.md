In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. 
It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. 
The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. 


## Example: Creating an empty Class in Python

class Dog:
    pass
